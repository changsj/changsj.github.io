>Something in the way she moves<br />
Attracts me like no other lover<br />
Something in the way she woos me<br />
I don't want to leave her now<br />
You know I believe and how<br />

只深信那不知来处的一见钟情<br />

>Somewhere in her smile she knows<br />
That I don't need no other lover<br />
Something in her style that shows me<br />
I don't want to leave her now<br />
You know I believe and how<br />

只深信所见 所见即所感 所见即指引<br />

>You're asking me will my love grow<br />
I don't know, I don't know<br />
You stick around, now it may show<br />
I don't know, I dont't know<br />

只深信那无知而狂烈的爱<br />

>Something in the way she knows<br />
And all I have to do is think of her<br />
Something in the things she shows me<br />
I don't want to leave her now<br />
You know I believe and how<br />

只深信心中已在一瞬间决定的必须去做的事<br />
<br />
